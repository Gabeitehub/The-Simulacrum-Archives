I am the newly appointed head Archivist to The Simulacrum Institute, replacing Rosie who retired before going missing for the past month.

So, it has become my responsibility to sort these into a more accessible system. Furthermore, the original audio recordings of these statements have been destroyed or corrupted for one reason or another. I don’t care to find out, I only care to do my job.

            </b></h3>
            <p>
                So, sometime around November of last year, I was working on an office building with my team. I used to do construction. Don’t anymore, for obvious reasons. We had set up most of the actual structure by that time, leaving me the job of placing windows into their openings. To stay out of the way of my mates, I started on the most complete side of the building, where no one was working. The job was routine: grab a pane, stick it in the hole, secure it, and bam you’ve got a window.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem started when I stepped through a door with jagged rusty nails protruding through the top and bottom of the frame. I made a mental note to yell at someone later and moved to the office’s single window. It was going fine, up until the point where I had to secure the pane. While I was holding the pane in place, I heard a click noise. Like someone snapping their fingers or clicking their teeth together.
            </p>
            <p>
                I turned around, finding nothing amiss. I sighed in relief, only to realize I had let go of the pane. I whipped my head around again only to find… concrete. Concrete where there had previously been open air. Of course, I was shocked, but I-

                I was shocked, but I put it off as exhaustion. I decided that it’d be a good idea then to take a break with my team. Walking out of the room, I noted that the door was fixed. I assumed that I had just entered another room and that the Florida heat was getting to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, I thought I was making my way back. But after a few minutes, I found myself completely lost among the empty grey rooms. I knew the stairwells were on the corners of the building. So, all I had to do was find an outer wall and follow it. But, that’s when I realized that I hadn’t seen a window since the weird door. I thought that maybe I was just circling the middle of the building, but no. A few minutes of walking North (I think) showed me that my previous assumption was wrong. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t remember much else after that. The rest of my time there was a blur of dull grey walkways and beige-peach carpet. I don’t know how long it had been when I saw that window, fully paned. You can’t really blame me for what I did next. Sure, I could have gone about it in a better way. But you can’t deny that if you were stuck somewhere with no way out—Just dull, grey, and boring for who knows how long—you’d take that leap too. Right?

                All in all, I don’t know how to feel about the whole thing. Sure, I lost my job. But, my wives, god bless them, have been able to keep us stable. Being paralyzed is shit, but It’s given me time to myself. Something I sorely needed. So, moral of the story: fuck offices, jump out of 3 story windows.

                Better. Ok so, we won’t be doing a follow up with Ms. Codlin seeing as she checked the box to not be contacted. However, she did provide copies of the office’s blueprints along with its address. Helpful.

                The investigations are usually performed by the Archivist’s assistants. However, I know virtually nothing about the three I’ve been left with. Thanks Liz. So, hopefully one of them, other than Nicky, are capable of doing this. You’ll hear from them now.

I assume whoever is listening to this has been filled in on all of the details so I’ll get right to the point. I am recording this as a log for the investigation of paranormal occurrences in the Earnshaw office building C… I think? Ms. Olivia kinda just rambled for a bit about endless corridors and to watch out for a door with nails stuck through it.

                It’s pretty late right now. I don’t really want to explain to some office workers that I'm a paranormal investigator. Hopefully, they’ll just let me in without a problem.

                Alright I’m in. This place is barely used. I’m pretty sure it's mainly for temporary renting rather than as a location for some company. Makes my job easier I guess.

                Y’know, I’m not sure why Ms. Olivia sent me out instead of Gabe or Nicky. With Gabe I can see it being a 50/50 between us. But, Nicky seems like they’d be more at home in a quiet, dark office than me. Not to mention that she’s a lot more aware of their surroundings than me, which would be useful in spotting a potentially shifting door… If it exists.

            <p>
                I don’t know how to feel about her. Rosie was nice, if not eccentric in their work. They just suddenly left, went missing, and now we have a lady that we have no connection to ordering us around. I mean, she seems nice, but we’re used to the way Rosie ran things. I’m sure we’ll get used to her eventually, but right now it’s a bit jarring going from mainly paperwork and research to ‘go out and find the monster.
